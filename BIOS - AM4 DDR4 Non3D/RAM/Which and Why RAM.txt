Stick to what's stated here, if no mention of it, then assume auto or default. ^^

■ XMP - Activate your OC Profile for your RAM, it should function most of the time as long as you built your PC well in terms of compatibility.
■ FCLK Frequency - Set it to half of your running frequency (e.g. Mine's at 3600MHz for XMP so I set it at 1800MHz).
■ UCLK DIV1 Mode - UCLK==MEMCLK

■ Power Down Enable - disabled
■ TSME - disabled
■ BankGroupSwap - disabled
■ BankGroupSwapAlt - Enabled
■ DRAM Latency Enhance - motherboard setting (try Enabled setting 1st if yours is stable with that: Enable > motherboard setting > disabled) 

■ tRRD_S - 4
■ tRRD_L - 8
■ tFAW - 20

*Test for stability I've included a mem test program for you.
