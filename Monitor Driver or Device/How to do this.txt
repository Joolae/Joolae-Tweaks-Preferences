A.) Do 1& 4 if it's your case
B.) other wise do 2>3>4 

Others:
Set monitor's latency to maximum overdrive if ghosting /artifacts is not that bad
You can also try other color profiles from Color Management
CIE RGB works the fastest for my system but with more washed colors (go with your preferences ^^)
